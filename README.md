## Refactoring Task - change code for Horieson Webpage to meet accessibility standards

WHEN you view the source code
THEN you will find semantic HTML elements; 'section' used for thematic Introduction of page, 'footer' used for Webpage authorship/copyright.
WHEN you view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN you will find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN you view the image elements
THEN you will find accessible alt attributes
WHEN you view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN you view the title element
THEN you will find a concise, descriptive title for "Horieson"

NOTE the following code improvements:

  ✓ Application's links all function correctly.

  ✓ Application's CSS selectors and properties are consolidated and organized to follow semantic structure.

  ✓ Application's CSS file is properly commented.

  ✓ Application deployed at live URL: https://whitneydb.github.io/Code_Refactor/

  ✓ Application loads with no errors.

  ✓ Application GitHub URL submitted (https://whitneydb.github.io/Code_Refactor/)

  ✓ GitHub repository contains application code.

  ✓ Application resembles mock-up provided in the homework instructions (at least 90%).

  ✓ Repository has a unique name.

  ✓ Repository follows best practices for file structure and naming conventions.

  ✓ Repository follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.

  ✓ Repository contains multiple descriptive commit messages. (I could have made more at the begining - got better towards end of fixes/changes).

  ✓ Repository contains quality README file with description, screenshots (parts 1&2), and link to deployed application (https://whitneydb.github.io/Code_Refactor/).
